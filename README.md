## Description
I built this site to showcase my skills in building applications using the React library. For the presentation of the data of the films, I used a public API called The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org/).
You can acess this on https://netflix-clone-henna.vercel.app/

#### Technologies

## How To Use

#### Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
